**Experience**

**Software Developer I**, Alyve Health Sept 2024 – Present

*•* At Alyve Health, I contributed to designing scalable backend systems and data integration pipelines to support digital health services and partner integrations, significantly improving automation, performance, and operational efficiency.

*•* Insurer-Hospital Mapping API Integration: Designed RESTful APIs to automate mapping between third-party insurers (e.g., FHPL) and 5,000+ hospital facilities, streamlining onboarding and claims routing, reducing manual dependencies.

*•* Automated WhatsApp Communication via WATI: Built WhatsApp communication flows using the WATI API integration to automate user notifications, resulting in a 25% increase in user engagement and reduced manual customer outreach by 70%.

*•* Backend and ETL Development: Built scalable backend services using Flask, Python, and MySQL focusing on clean data modeling. Automated ETL pipelines using cron jobs and AWS S3 for data ingestion, transformation, and archival, improving API response times by 40% and enabling consistent data availability for analytics.

*•* Health camp communication system: Built automated health camp communication using APIs, cron jobs, and WATI WhatsApp integration. Processed Excel files for non-integrated partners, generating orders and validating PII with email alerts on mismatches. For integrated partners, fetched and verified reports via partner APIs. Delivered digitized reports through WhatsApp, triggering ops alerts for exceptions.

*•* Testing, CI/CD and DevOps: Implemented robust unit and integration test suites achieving 98% test coverage, reducing production bugs by 35%. Contributed to CI/CD pipelines using Git, Shell scripting, and followed Agile sprint cycles. Managed deployments in a Linux environment with backups on AWS EC2 and S3.
